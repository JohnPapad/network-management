Ioannis Papadopoulos
Giannis Lamprou

## App2
Dimitris Gaggas
Nemanja Nedic

# How to run
In this sequence:
```export TERM=exterm-color```
```./distribution-karaf-0.5.4-Boron-SR4/bin/karaf â€“of13```
```python2 backend.py```
```cd net-man-app && npm start```

if you close mininet use this to reset it.
```sudo mn -c```

# Application Documentation
## App1: Node.js application for extracting statistics from OpenDaylight about the network
localhost:3000

## App2: Djikstra Shortest Path algorithm implementation on the network in order to find the shortest path between two switches

This app will find the shortest path between two switches, then install some flows to create a path between them.
It uses Flask micro web framework to provide a web interface for the functions of our app.


Namely:
### localhost:5000/network
 #### GET
 #### POST
 #### DDELETE

### localhost:5000/shortest_path
 #### GET
 #### POST
 #### DELETE

### localhost:5000/flows
 #### GET
 #### POST
 #### DELETE

### localhost:5000/hello
 #### GET
 
### localhost:5000/pingall
